1. Write a Program to display current time using the format from user(according to the format codes for date time in standard C implementation)

Hint: you need to import datetime and find the current time like below

import datetime

current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

Hint: check the format for time specifiers from link

string -- Common string operations -- Python 3.12.0 documentation

Expected output below(1st line actual current time without formatting and second with format specifier)

2023-07-28 11:05:59.383320
current time is Friday-Jul-23 11-05-59


2. Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user i.e. One positive and one negative number and displays the output with + and - signs

Expected output:
Enter first number is 5
Enter second number is -7
The first number you entered is +5
The second number you entered is -7


3. Write a program that accepts floating point zero negative number for the user and displays it as positive zero after rounding
    off to precision 2.

Expected output below

Enter the number -0.000045
The number you entered is 0.00


4. Write a Program to get the below output
Hint: use the align from format specifiers

price of item1 is ********30
price of item2 is *******200
price of item3 is *****20000
price of item4 is ****200000
price of item5 is ***2000000
price of item6 is **20000000
price of item7 is *200000000
price of item8 is 2000000000


5. Write a program that accepts a number from the user as input (may be a variable a) and print that number in different 
formats

Expected output

Enter the number 50
Value in different format is

decimal 50
binary 110010
octal 62
hexadecimal 32


6. Write a program that accepts a number from a user and displays it with , as a thousand separator.
    
Expected output

Enter the number 251332
The number is 251,332


7. Write a program to display both the expression text and its value after evaluation like taking 2 input numbers 1 and 2 from users
into variables a and b and display there sum(value 3) along with expression(a+b)

Expected output

Enter the first number 1
Enter the second number 2
The sum of a+b is a+b=3


8. Write a program that accepts an input string from a user and checks whether it has all digits

Expected output 

Enter the string 12345
True

Hint: use the string method to return Boolean
